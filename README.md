Introduction: Domain problem characterization\\
Visualization of NCAA men's basketball tournament for the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)

Data/operation abstraction design:
Clean data from my professor [Chase Romano]([https://github.com/cromano8](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chase-romano-0aa4046b/) and his Teaching Assistant [Joseph Burns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeburns91/)

Future work:
More visualizations to filter per team and season, add a visualization to show what activities contributed to the total score, and what features correlated to wins.
